# pelican-bootstrap3-nero

Pelican-bootstrap3 is a Bootstrap 3 theme for Pelican, originally developed by [DandyDev](https://github.com/DandyDev). It's fully responsive and contains sub-themes from the Bootswatch project. Pelican-bootstrap3 is compatible with Pelican 3.3.0 and higher.

Pelican-bootstrap3-nero is forked from pelican-bootstrap3 and customized. It is a dark theme.

## Demo site
Currently I don't have a demo site for this theme. It is becaused I moved to a new theme using Bootstrap 4: [pelican-bootstrap4-nero](https://github.com/kappa-wingman/pelican-bootstrap4-nero)
